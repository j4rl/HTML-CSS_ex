# HTML & CSS Examples and Exercises

Short, focused demos and tasks for teaching and learning modern HTML and CSS.

## Goals
- Get comfortable with semantic HTML, forms, and media.
- Master CSS fundamentals: the box model, selectors, and layout.
- Build responsive components using **Flexbox**, **Grid**, and **Container Queries**.
- Explore modern CSS: **:has()**, **nesting**, **@layer**, **subgrid**, and custom properties.

## How to use
1. Open `index.html` and jump to a module or exercise.
2. Each exercise has a `TASK.md`, a `starter/` and a `solution/`.
3. Recommended workflow: VS Code + Live Server, or GitHub Pages.

## Browser support notes
- `:has()` is now widely supported in modern browsers.  
- Container queries (`@container`, `container-type`) are broadly supported.  
- Subgrid is supported across major engines.  
- Native CSS nesting and cascade layers (`@layer`) are available in modern browsers.
